### Topic Description:
In aeronautics, animal wing designs have long been applied to aircraft innovation. Researchers have looked into butterfly, bee, and dragonfly wings to improve the flight of objects, like airplanes. However, there has been a lack of focus in analyzing the advantages of fly wing designs to be applied in aeronautics, resulting in missed opportunities to improve aircraft. <br>

A recent study highlights the critical wing characteristics of different species of flies that have helped them maneuver in the air efficiently, some of which are flexibility, shape, orientation, and chemical composition (Krishna et al., 2019). <br>

Flies are known for their exceptional flight stability and unconventional, but unique and effective, clap-and-fling flight mechanism (Jadhav et al., 2019). This study will essentially employ biomimicry by investigating the structure, chemical composition, and dynamics of blowfly wings with air in order to apply them to aircraft wings to make them more flight-efficient but sustainable and lightweight.
